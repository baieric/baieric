I'm a software engineer at Instagram. If I'm on Github, it's probably to work on a side project or to update [my blog](https://ericbai.co/).

My most notable side projects are [ChatStats](https://github.com/baieric/chatstats) and [Xcerpt](https://ericbai.co/selected-press-and-media-for-xcerpt) (now defunct).

Besides coding, I've been passing time in quarantine by [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8518495-eric), [watching movies](https://letterboxd.com/ericbai/), writing, and running.
