Hi! I'm a software engineer at Instagram. If I'm on Github, it's probably to work on a side project or to update [✨ my blog ✨](https://ericbai.co/).

My most notable side projects are [Connect the Stars](https://connectthestars.xyz/), [ChatStats](https://github.com/baieric/chatstats) and [Xcerpt](https://ericbai.co/selected-press-and-media-for-xcerpt) (now defunct).

Besides ⌨️ coding, I've mainly been passing time in quarantine by [📚 reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8518495-eric), [🍿 watching movies](https://letterboxd.com/ericbai/), ✍🏼 writing, and 🏃🏻 running.
